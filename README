UnexceptionalIO provides a basic type to witness having caught all
exceptions you can safely handle.  This library builds on that with
transformers like ExceptT to provide a more ergonomic tool for many
cases.

It is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.

> import UnexceptionalIO.Trans (UIO)
> import qualified UnexceptionalIO.Trans as UIO
